# Welcome

The course **OCR (Online Collaborative Resources)** introduces tools and practices for **reproducible and collaborative science**.  
It is designed for students who want to learn how to:  

- Organize their work for transparency and reproducibility  
- Use version control systems such as **Git**  
- Collaborate effectively on shared projects  
- Document analyses and results in a reproducible way

# Course content

During this course, you will explore:

1. **Introduction**  
   Why reproducibility and collaboration matter in science, and the main challenges researchers face.  

2. **Setting up your framework**  
   Installing and configuring the software environment (Git, Quarto, etc.).  

3. **Git basics (working alone)**  
   Understanding repositories, commits, and tracking changes in your own projects.  

4. **Working collaboratively**  
   Using branches, pull requests, and collaborative workflows on shared repositories.  

5. **Final assignment**  
   Applying what you learned in a collaborative project.

# Final Assignment

The final project of this course is to **collaboratively produce a set of reminders about basic statistical concepts**.  

- Each student will write a short note (max 1 page) on a chosen concept (e.g., mean, variance, regression, probability).  
- Notes will be written in **Quarto (`.qmd`) files** inside a shared repository.  
- You will practice **Git collaboration** by creating branches, making commits, and opening pull requests.  
- You are also requested to review others' production and provide useful comments, accet or not pull requests
- At the end, all contributions will be merged into a **collective resource: a mini-encyclopedia of statistics reminders**.  

This project will allow you to **experience real-world collaborative workflows** while reinforcing key concepts in statistics.
