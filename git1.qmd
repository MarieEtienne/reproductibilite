# Starting from an existing directory

## Cloning an existing reprository 

This means copy locally on your computer the content of a repository which 

* the actual code and text contents
* the history of all changes

Before, we nedd basic bash command

## First element - navigating using bash command 

Navigating Directories in the Terminal / Git Bash

1. Checking where you are

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
$ pwd
/home/marie/projects
```


2. Listing files

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
ls -l #→ long listing
ls -a #→ include hidden files
```


3. Moving between directories

| Action            | Linux/macOS/Git Bash | Windows Command Prompt |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Go to a directory | `cd folder_name`     | `cd folder_name`       |
| Go up one level   | `cd ..`              | `cd ..`                |
| Go to home        | `cd ~`               | `cd %USERPROFILE%`     |
| Absolute path     | `cd /path/to/folder` | `cd C:\path\to\folder` |

4. Create a directory 

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
mkdir my_git_dir
```

5. Quick tips

Use `Tab` for autocomplete paths and filenames.

Paths on Git Bash use `/`, even on Windows (`/c/Users/...`).

## Exercise

* Go to your home directory (`/home/login`in Linux, probably somethin like `C:/Users/yourusername` in Windows)

* Create a directory named `git`, where you will store all your git projects

* Jump within this directory

* list the files contained in this directory

* Jump  outside this directory

## Cloning an existing reprository 

Go to your git Directory and write

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
git clone git@github.com:MarieEtienne/stats-reminders.git
```

### What is happening ?

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
ls
cd stats-reminders
ls
```

### Where to find this magical adress to clone

Navigate to the repository you want to clone
On the main page, click on the "Code" green button, be sure to select SSH and copy paste the address.


## Reviewing the code development


```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
git log
git log --oneline
gitk
```

## Forking an existing repository

### What is forking?
Forking creates your own copy of someone else's repository in your GitHub account. This lets you experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
How to fork a repo:

### How 
Navigate to the repository you want to fork on GitHub
Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the repository page
Choose where to fork it - usually to your personal account
Wait a moment - GitHub will create the copy in your account

### What happens next:
You'll have a complete copy of the repo in your GitHub account
You can clone this forked version to your local machine using git clone
Make changes, commit them, and push back to your fork
If you want to contribute back to the original project, you can create a pull request

### Key points
Your fork is independent of the original repo
You have full control over your forked version
The original repo remains unchanged unless you submit a pull request that gets accepted
You can sync your fork with the original repo later if it gets updated

This workflow is essential for contributing to open-source projects or collaborating on code when you don't have direct write access to the original repository.
